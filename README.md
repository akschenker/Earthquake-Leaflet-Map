# earthquake-leaflet

In this assignment, I used d3.js, Mapbox, and Leaflet to create a map of earthquake data from the past week. The data was obtained from USGS data, which I accessed using d3. I then made a map using a map tile from the Mapbox API, and applied the data to the map using Leaflet. This included markers, popups, and a legend.

## Prerequisites

The CDNs for d3.js and leaflet.js are linked in `index.html`. Source data was obtained from the [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).

## Built With
